            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>BEing full of ≈øad Apprehen≈øions concerning the danger and evil of the Treaty with the King, and of any Accommodation with Him, or Re≈øtitution of Him thereupon, We did by our late Remon≈øtrance, upon the Rea≈øons and Grounds therein expre≈ø≈øed, make our Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereby unto the pre≈øent Hou≈øe of Commons, that the dangerous evil of that way might be avoided, and the Peace of the Kingdom ≈øetled upon more righteous, ≈øafe and hopeful Grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> a more equal di≈øpen≈øing of Ju≈øtice and Mercy in relation to things done or ≈øuffered in the late Wars, and the e≈øtabli≈øhing of the future Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Kingdom upon a ≈øafe Succe≈ø≈øion and equal Con≈øtitution of Parliaments, and that (for the ending of pre≈øent, and avoiding of future Differences) to be Ratified by an Agreement and Sub≈øcription the people thereunto.</p>
            <p>This cour≈øe we took, out of our tender care and earne≈øt de≈øire, That all ways of Extremity might be avoided, and that tho≈øe matters of highe≈øt concernment to the publique Intere≈øt of this Nation, might be pur≈øued and provided for (if po≈ø≈øible) by tho≈øe who≈øe proper Work and Tru≈øt in was. And herein we were willing to hope, That the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons ≈øo tru≈øted, or the majority of them, might po≈ø≈øibly have been either driven into that de≈øtructive way by forcible Impul≈øions, or lap≈øed thereinto through ≈øome Incon≈øideration, or Mi≈øapprehen≈øions
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:162462:3"/>and conceived Jealou≈øies: And therefore we did carefully decline the in≈øi≈øting upon any thing that might continue or renue any former Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øies or Animo≈øities, and kept onely to ≈øuch things as were of nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity or advantage to the common Cau≈øe, and of common and equal concernment to tho≈øe that have engaged in it: Which things we pre≈ø≈øed in the way of Rea≈øon and Per≈øwa≈øion onely, that they might be duly and timely con≈øidered. But to our grief we finde, in ≈øtead of any Satisfaction or a rea≈øonable An≈øwer thereto, they are wholly rejected, without any con≈øideration of what ever Rea≈øon or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice might be in the things ≈øet forth or propounded therein; for what le≈øs can be under≈øtood, when the things propounded were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the avoidance of evils appearing in the Treaty with the King: And yet they put off the con≈øideration of them, till there ≈øhould be no place left for any con≈øideration at all: Fir≈øt, laying it a≈øide till Monday la≈øt, by which time the Treaty (as then ≈øuppo≈øed) would have been concluded; but that failing, and two days more being added to the Treaty, the con≈øideration of our <hi>Remon≈øtrance,</hi> on the day appointed, was waved and laid a≈øide; the Treaty, the mean while, going on in the former way and terms, and like to be concluded the very next day.</p>
            <p>Now, though we are far from that pre≈øumption, that the things ≈øhould therefore be an≈øwered or con≈øidered, becau≈øe propounded by us, ≈øave for the Rea≈øon, Ju≈øtice, or publique concernment therein; yet, having no An≈øwer, or any thing ≈øhewed to us the contrary, we cannot but upon the grounds Remon≈øtrated (and many more which might be added) remain confident in our former Apprehen≈øions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. And ≈øeeing the prevailing part of tho≈øe, to whom we did apply, to have, as it were, their eyes wilfully ≈øhut, and ears ≈øtopt, again≈øt any thing of Light or Rea≈øon offered to them, we finde no place left for our former charitable or hopeful Apprehen≈øions, concerning their error in ≈øuch evil ways; but remaining fully a≈ø≈øured of the danger and de≈øtructivene≈øs thereof, as to all tho≈øe publique ends for which they were intru≈øted, and al≈øo of the ju≈øt advantage and nece≈ø≈øity which lye in the things we have propounded and in≈øi≈øt on, we now ≈øee nothing left, to which their engaging and per≈øi≈øting in ≈øuch ways, and rejection of the≈øe better things propounded, can rationally be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted le≈øs then a treacherous or corrupt neglect of, and Apo≈øtacy from the publique Tru≈øt repo≈øed in them; although we could wi≈øh from our ≈øouls, we might yet finde the contrary. Neverthele≈øs, we do not in the≈øe things a≈ø≈øume a ≈øtanding Power of Judgement (as of Right or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:162462:3"/>Tru≈øt) to conclude others thereby, acknowledging that to lye mo≈øt properly in tho≈øe whom the people duly choo≈øe and tru≈øt to Judge for them: But con≈øidering that ≈øuch power, where it is, is committed but in Tru≈øt, and that neither this, nor any other people, did ever give up their natural capacities of common Sence or Rea≈øon, as to the ends and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of that Tru≈øt, and that as to the breach of ≈øuch Tru≈øt, there is no higher formal power of man in being to Appeal unto for Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ≈øuch ca≈øe (as all others concerned in ≈øuch breaches of Tru≈øt will) ≈øo as we cannot but exerci≈øe that Common Judgement which in our Natural Capacity is left to us: And though in ≈ømaller failers of ≈øuch Tru≈øt, which might be born, without hazard of De≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that Intere≈øt, and tho≈øe People, for which e≈øpecially the Tru≈øt is, or where the Tru≈øtees were of an indifferent equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution, in reference to the whole, or where we had an orderly and open way left for a ju≈øt ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of another formal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judicature to be appealed unto in due time; we ≈øhould not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe or hold forth our private Judgements to the lea≈øt di≈øturbance of that orderly and peaceable cour≈øe of Judgement ≈øo e≈øtabli≈øht; yet in our pre≈øent ca≈øe we are ≈øo fully convinced of the greatne≈øs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructivene≈øs of tho≈øe evils we have declared again≈øt, and of the nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity and e≈ø≈øentiallity of tho≈øe better things we have de≈øired and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and how incon≈øi≈øtent it is with the publique Tru≈øt, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental ends of it, ≈øtill to pur≈øue the one, and reject the other, as that we dare with confidence appeal therein to the common Judgements of indifferent and uncorrupted men, and to the more righteous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God above all.</p>
            <p>And as the incompetency of this Parliament, in its pre≈øent con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give an ab≈øolute and conclu≈øive Judgement for the whole (e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be the ≈øole Judges of their own performance, or breach of Tru≈øt) doth make the ju≈øter way for ≈øuch an Appeal, ≈øo indeed we ≈øee no other way left for remedy, in regard the pre≈øent unlimitted continuance of this Parliament doth exclude the orderly ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of any other more equal formal Judicature of men, to which we might hope in due time other ways to appeal.</p>
            <p>Thus then we apprehend our ≈øelves in the pre≈øent ca≈øe, both nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to, and ju≈øtified in an Appeal from this Parliament, in the pre≈øent con≈øtitution as it ≈øtands, unto the extraordinary Judgement of God and good people; and yet in the pro≈øecution of this Appeal as we ≈øhall drive it on, but to the ≈øpeedy obtaining of a more orderly and equal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:162462:4"/>Judicature of men, in a ju≈øt Repre≈øentative, according to our Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrance (wherein to acquie≈øce) ≈øo in the pre≈øent procuring of Ju≈øtice with the peoples ca≈øe and quiet, and in the ≈øetling of the Kingdom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a due, ≈øafe and hopeful ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of Parliaments: It is our hearts de≈øire, and ≈øhall be our endeavor, that ≈øo much, both of the matter and form of the pre≈øent Parliamentary Authority may be pre≈øerved, as can be ≈øafe, or will be u≈øeful to the≈øe ends, until a ju≈øt and full Con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, both for matter and form (≈øuitable to the publique ends it ≈øerves for) can be introduced.</p>
            <p>And therefore fir≈øt, It ≈øhould be our great rejoycing (if God ≈øaw it good) that the majority of the pre≈øent Hou≈øe of Commons were become ≈øen≈øible of the evil and de≈øtructivene≈øs of their late way, and would re≈øolvedly and vigorou≈øly apply them≈øelves to the ≈øpeedy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Ju≈øtice, with the righting and ea≈øing of the oppre≈ø≈øed people, and to a ju≈øt and ≈øafe ≈øettlement of the Kingdom upon ≈øuch foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as have been propounded by us and others for that purpo≈øe, and would for the ≈øpeedier and ≈øurer pro≈øecution of the≈øe things, exclude from Communication in their Councels, all ≈øuch corrupt and Apo≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Members as have appeared hitherto, but to ob≈øtruct and hinder ≈øuch matter of Ju≈øtice, Safety, and publique-Intere≈øt, and to pervert their Councels a contrary way, and have therein ≈øo ≈øhamefully both fal≈øified and forfeited their Tru≈øt.</p>
            <p>But however (if God ≈øhall not ≈øee it good to vouch≈øafe that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them and the Kingdom) we ≈øhall, ≈øecondly, de≈øire, That ≈øo many of them as God hath kept upright, and ≈øhall touch with a ju≈øt ≈øence of tho≈øe things, would by Prote≈øtation, or otherwi≈øe, acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves from ≈øuch breach of Tru≈øt, and approve their faithfulne≈øs, by withdrawing from tho≈øe that per≈øi≈øt in the guilt thereof, and would apply them≈øelves to ≈øuch a po≈øture, whereby they may ≈øpeedily and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually pro≈øecute tho≈øe nece≈ø≈øary and publique ends, without ≈øuch Interruptions, Diver≈øions, or Depravations of their Councels from the re≈øt, to their endle≈øs trouble, oppre≈ø≈øion and hazard of the Kingdom as Formerly, and for ≈øo many of them, who≈øe hearts God ≈øhal ≈øtir up thus to do; we ≈øhall therein, in this ca≈øe of extremity, look upon them as per≈øons having materially the chief Tru≈øt of the kingdom remaining in them, and though not a formal ≈øtanding power to be continued in them, or drawn into ordinary Pre≈øidents; yet the be≈øt and mo≈øt rightful that can be had, as the pre≈øent ≈øtate and exigence of Affairs now ≈øtand; And we ≈øhall accordingly own them, adhere to them,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:162462:4"/>and be guided by them in their faithful pro≈øecution of that Tru≈øt, in order unto, and until the introducing of a more full and formal power in a ju≈øt Repre≈øentative to be ≈øpeedy endeavored.</p>
            <p>Now yet further to take away all jealou≈øies in relation to our ≈øelves, which might withhold or di≈øcour≈øe any hone≈øt Members from this courage, as we have the witne≈øs of God in our hearts, that in the≈øe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings we do not ≈øeek, but even re≈øolve we will not take advantages to our ≈øelves, either in point of Profit or Power; and that if God did open unto us a way, wherein with hone≈øty and faithfulne≈øs to the publique Intere≈øt, and good people engaged for us, we might pre≈øently be di≈øcharged, ≈øo as we might not in our pre≈øent Employments look on, and be acce≈ø≈øory to, yea ≈øupporters of the Parliament, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent corrupt, oppre≈ø≈øive and de≈øtructive proceedings, we ≈øhould with rejoycing, and without more ado, embrace ≈øuch a di≈øcharge, rather then interpo≈øe in the≈øe things to our own va≈øt trouble and hazard; ≈øo if we could but obtain a rational a≈ø≈øurance for the effectual pro≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the≈øe things, we ≈øhall give any proportionable a≈ø≈øurance on our parts, concerning our laying down of Arms, when, and as we ≈øhould be required: But for the pre≈øent, as the ca≈øe ≈øtands, we apprehend our ≈øelves obliged in duty to God, this Kingdom, and good men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to improve our utmo≈øt abilities in all hone≈øt ways, for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the≈øe great evils we have Remon≈øtrated, and for pro≈øecution of the good things we have propounded; and al≈øo that ≈øuch per≈øons who were the Inviters of the late Inva≈øion from <hi>Scotland,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
